#Using The Reflection API To Measure Stability

###Module: Advanced Object Oriented Software Development
###Lecturer: Dr John Healy

##Introduction

This program uses the Reflection Api to calculate Positional Stability of each class contained with in a Jar file.
The stability metric is calculate by finding both the Efferent(ce) and Afferent(ca) couplings of each class and then by using following calculation I =  ce/ce + ca. In order to find find the dependancies and different couplings of each class, we used the Reflection API.
This project is made as a part of college work.
